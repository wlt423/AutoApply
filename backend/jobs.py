```python
@jobs_bp.route('/jobs', methods=['GET'])
def get_jobs():
    user_id = 1  # Replace with actual user ID from session or token
    user_profile = UserProfile.query.get(user_id)
    job_type_preference = user_profile.job_type_preference

    # Fetch jobs from Indeed API with Quick Apply filter
    response = requests.get(f'https://api.indeed.com/ads/apisearch?publisher=YOUR_API_KEY&q={job_type_preference}&l=remote&filter=quickapply')
    jobs = response.json().get('results', [])
    return jsonify(jobs), 200
```
**Note**: Ensure that the Indeed API supports filtering for "Quick Apply" listings. If not, you may need to handle this logic in the scraping process.

### Instructions:
1. **Update Requirements**: Ensure that `beautifulsoup4` is included in your `requirements.txt`.
2. **Implement Web Scraping Logic**: Create the `scraper.py` file to handle web scraping for job application forms.
3. **Update LLM Integration**: Modify the `llm.py` file to use the web scraping logic and fill out application forms.
4. **Update Job Application Logic**: Modify the `/apply` endpoint in `jobs.py` to use the web scraping and LLM integration.
5. **Ensure Quick Apply Listings**: Update the job search logic to filter for "Quick Apply" listings.

### Next Steps:
- **Testing**: Test the integration with the Indeed API and ensure that the LLM generates application content correctly.
- **Deployment**: Consider deploying the application to a cloud platform, ensuring that the `.env` file is configured correctly in the production environment.
- **Additional Features**: Implement additional features such as user preferences for job locations, advanced search options, and more.
